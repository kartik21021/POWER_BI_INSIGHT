# 📊 My First Power BI Dashboard – Data Jobs Insight

Hey there! 👋  
This is the **first dashboard** I created using **Power BI**. I had never used it before — just explored, learned, and built this from scratch.  
It’s based on data about **global data jobs, salaries, and remote roles**, and it took me just a few hours to put together.

> **"Practice makes you better, for sure."**  
> This dashboard is proof of that.

## 🔍 What You’ll See in the Dashboard

This report answers questions like:
- Which **data job titles** are paid the most globally?
- How do **average salaries** differ by country?
- How many data jobs are **remote** vs. on-site?
- Which job titles offer the **most remote opportunities**?

## 📈 Charts and Visuals Used

Here’s what I used to bring the insights to life:
- ✅ **Stacked Bar Chart** – for comparing salaries across job titles
- ✅ **Line Chart** – to show salary trends across countries
- ✅ **Pie Chart** – for % of remote vs. on-site roles
- ✅ **Map Visual** – to show global salary distribution
- ✅ **Card Tiles** – to highlight KPIs like max salary, remote job count
- ✅ **Slicers** – to filter by job title, country, or job type (remote/on-site)
